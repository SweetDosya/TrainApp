## 💡 Code Example

If you want to understand the project architecture, start with the user workout management flow. The application revolves around workout programs, exercise collections, and calendar scheduling synchronized through Firebase Firestore.
```python
program_data = {
    "name": "Push Day",
    "exercises": selected_exercises,
    "exercise_count": len(selected_exercises)
}

user_db.create_workout_program(program_data)
```

This demonstrates the core idea behind the application: creating and managing workout programs that can later be assigned to specific days within the workout calendar.

## Design Goals
- Mobile-first user experience
- Easy workout customization
- Future Improvements
- Offline mode support
